# Working conventions

## Architecture

This is Ceres's canonical repository: it owns the DSP engine in
`Source/DSP/` and the JUCE plug-in (VST3, AU, CLAP, Standalone) that wraps it.
The engine is the tested C++17 circuit synthesizer `ceres.cpp`/`ceres.hpp`;
the JUCE plug-in plays it through `ceres::Synth` and takes its parameters
from the engine's own descriptor table (`ceres::parameterInfo`). The existing Reason Rack Extension lives in the private
`protocodus/reason-rack-extensions` repository as a thin adapter that mounts
this repository as the pinned submodule `Examples/Ceres/Instrument` and
compiles `Source/DSP/ceres.cpp` with `CERES_EMBEDDED_TARGET` directly. DSP and playing-model changes land here
first; the Rack pin then advances. Reason property mapping, MIDI/CV, routing,
host latency, patches and panels stay in the adapter.

Repository layout, naming, CI, versions and the `Docs/` taxonomy follow the
Protocodus portfolio standard kept in the project, not in this repository.

- The DSP version is the product version: `project(Ceres VERSION X.Y.Z)` in
  `CMakeLists.txt`. Any DSP or behaviour change bumps it, and versions only go
  up. A Rack device would take the same `X.Y.Z` plus its own stage suffix.
- `Source/DSP/` is JUCE-free and C++17 (the Rack toolchain);
  `CeresDSPCxx17` compiles `ceres.cpp` the way the Rack does (C++17,
  `CERES_EMBEDDED_TARGET`, no exceptions); `ceres` and `ceres_embedded`
  explicitly compile the circuit engine as C++17. No allocation, file I/O, locks or
  exceptions on the audio thread.
- `PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE Cers` / `PLUGIN_CODE Cer1`, `BUNDLE_ID` and the
  CLAP id `cz.protocodus.ceres` never change once a build reaches users:
  hosts recall sessions by them.
- This repository is public. Never add Reason/Jukebox SDK material, firmware,
  ROM data, captured audio, secrets or unreleased commercial material.

## Documentation layout

`README.md` is the single product document. It opens with the heading and a
one-paragraph intro, the editor screenshot, **Audio demos**, a concise
**Version history** ledger and **Downloads**; after a `---` separator come
**How it works**, **Known gaps**, **Build** and **Licensing**. Long per-version
narratives go to `Docs/release/` and are linked.

Everything else in `Docs/` has one home, and nothing sits loose there except
`decisions.md`, the by-ear decision log described below:

| Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `audio/` | rendered demos, per-fix previews, committed listening tests |
| `screenshots/` | editor images |
| `guide/` | user, install and preset guides, parameter meaning |
| `research/` | modelling research, references, design notes, experiments |
| `validation/` | audits, test results, host validation |
| `benchmarks/` | CPU and performance measurements |
| `plans/` | improvement plans, requirements, open work |
| `release/` | release checklists, readiness, release notes, asset provenance |

Name documents in lowercase kebab-case, `<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for dated
work. Moving a document is a rename only: keep its content and date, and update
every link to it in the same commit. Legal files (`LICENSE`,
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `PRIVACY.md`) stay at the root; upstream licence
texts live in `ThirdParty/`.

Research the code depends on — a specific value, a manual page, a measurement,
a derivation — belongs in a comment **beside the code that uses it**, not only
in a document that drifts away from it. A measurement protocol belongs at the
head of the tool that enforces it.

These README parts are written by the build, never by hand:

- The demo table between `<!-- audio-demos-begin -->` and
  `<!-- audio-demos-end -->`, rendered from one
  `Docs/audio/midi/<NN>-<preset-slug>.mid` per factory preset (change a source
  only on purpose, in its own commit) and committed by the main build as
  `Docs/audio/<NN>-<preset-slug>.mp3`.
- The block between `<!-- build-download-begin -->` and
  `<!-- build-download-end -->`, rewritten by the main build, which also
  commits the README screenshot under `Docs/screenshots/`.

Version history is a ledger of what changed about the product — what it
sounds like, what it exposes, what a session must know. Pure refactors,
deduplications and test-coverage additions belong in git history, not in it.

Per-fix audio previews are **one-time review evidence**: render them while the
change is under review, then leave them frozen. Do not re-render them when
later engine changes make them stale.

## A–Z listening tests

This is a physical model with no owned calibration captures, so there are
decisions the measurements cannot close. When a change is audible and the
physics admits more than one defensible option, **render the options as WAVs,
letter them, and let the user decide the direction by ear.** A listening test is
a legitimate way to choose between candidates. It is not a way to fit a number —
see the limit below.

**When to run one.** Whenever any of these is true:

- two or more formulations are each derivable and the model cannot say which
  describes the instrument (which radiation law a body obeys, which of two
  reference geometries a term should be measured against);
- a change is audible and the open question is whether it is an improvement
  rather than whether it is correct;
- a calibrated constant has to be re-pinned and more than one pinning is
  defensible;
- the user asks for one.

Do not run one to decide something a measurement already decides. If a number
settles it, quote the number.

**How to build one.**

- **A is always the shipping engine**, unchanged. B, C, … Z are the candidates.
  So "A against B" is always "what it does now against what it would do".
- **Letters only in the filenames.** `A.wav`, `B.wav`, … carry no hint of the
  mechanism, so the listener is not primed by the label. Write the key down at
  the same time, in a separate `key.md` the user can read after deciding, and
  say in the handover that the key exists and is unread-by-design.
- **Change one thing.** Identical MIDI, seed, sample rate, block size, length
  and controls across every letter; only the mechanism under test differs.
- **Level-match, and say how.** Match on whole-file RMS unless level is itself
  what is being judged, and state the measure and the trims applied. Louder
  reads as better, and an unmatched set tests loudness.
- **Give the same material to every letter**, and pick material that exposes the
  thing under test — a stroke that drives the mechanism hard, not a general
  demo. Keep it short enough to A/B repeatedly.
- Render through the shipping signal path, never through an offline
  approximation of it.

**Where they live.** Listening tests are decision artefacts, not review
evidence. Render them to a working directory and send them to the user; do not
commit them by default — a 26-file set per decision would bloat the repository.
Commit a set only when the user asks, under
`Docs/audio/listening-tests/<date>-<topic>/` with its `key.md`, and freeze it
on merge exactly like the per-fix previews above.

**What gets committed is the verdict.** Record in `Docs/decisions.md` what was
being decided, what each letter was, which letter the user chose, and what that
choice licensed. A direction chosen by ear is recorded as chosen by ear — never
written up as though a measurement had settled it.

**The limit.** A listening test chooses between candidates that are each already
defensible on their own physics. It does not license drawing a constant, fitting
a curve, or keeping a formulation the measurements reject. If every candidate
needs an invented number, the answer is still that none of them ships.

## Build and verify

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-dsp -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCERES_BUILD_PLUGIN=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-dsp --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build-dsp -L unit --output-on-failure
```

Use a separate `build-plugin` directory (`-DCERES_BUILD_PLUGIN=ON`, the
default) for the processor, editor and packaging. Every test is
`Ceres.<Suite>` with one tier label: `unit`, `audio` (`Ceres.AudioDemos`,
every existing standalone circuit research preset rendered twice),
`render` (`Ceres.EditorRender`, the editor screenshot) or `fuzz` (`Ceres.DspFuzz`; `Ceres.ParameterMatrix` in
the plug-in build). Select the suites that cover a change with `-R`, then run
the full suite before a substantive DSP change is called done.

A test is never skipped, disabled or loosened to get green. Diagnose a failed
contract against the baseline before changing a fixture, and document why an
assumption was stale.

## Shared portfolio tools

`Tools/PresetDemoRenderer.h`, `Tools/update_readme_blocks.py`,
`Tests/ParameterMatrix.h` and `Tests/FuzzHarness.h`, and the Documentation
layout and A–Z listening tests sections above, are byte-identical copies of
the portfolio masters in `reason-rack-extensions/Tools/portfolio/`. Change
them there, never here. Ceres's own parts are `Tools/RenderPresetDemos.cpp`
(the preset list and demo voice) and `Tests/ParameterMatrixTests.cpp` (the
limits Ceres's design implies).

## Sibling evidence (owner decision, 2026-10-21)

Where no CS-50 document or measured unit settles a value, the CS-80, CS-60
and CS-30 service documents are acceptable evidence for a circuit or chip the
CS-50 shares: the same board, the same custom IC, or a schematic that matches
part for part. Check that match before borrowing, cite the sibling document
and page beside the value in the code, and call it sibling evidence in the
documents, never a CS-50 measurement. A sibling procedure that states a
condition the CS-50's documents leave out decides between readings; under the
A–Z limit it overrides an earlier by-ear choice of a reading it rejects, and
`Docs/decisions.md` records that. Reviews and forum posts can corroborate a
value; they do not ground one.
